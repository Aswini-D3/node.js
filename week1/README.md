## Code in class

### class_contact_list

This is the contact list example I wrote in week0, rewritten as a class.

### npm_example

This is the babel boilerplate that we build useing npm. It's important you have this running because from now on we will use ES6. Cover everything about npm is not easy and if you are bit confused about commondas we used today in the class remember the [npm docs](https://docs.npmjs.com/) is your best friend.
